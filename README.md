## What is R?

R is a scripting language originally developed at the University of Aukland, NZ for statistically data analysis. R software is open-source and free software and uses [GNU General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Version_2). R runs natively in a command line interface. R software is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. The base source code is maintained by the R Core Team, but additional software packages are developed by thousands of independent people around the world. 

Scripting languages like R are very useful for data exploration and analysis because they offer limitless customization for instructing a computer to do something. They can, however, take more time to learn compared with purely graphical user interface (GUI) programs (think Microsoft Word). 

## What is RStudio?

Rstudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) built specifically for using the R language. It was developed by Posit PBC and uses the license [GNU Affero General Public License version 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Affero_General_Public_License)
